<p>There are also some helper functions under IComponentHook which can be used to combine adaptive and elmish together for better performance in <strong>simple use cases</strong>. Because in adaptive data, you can subscribe the data you are interested and trigger the specific UI part when the piece of data is actually changed. Unlike normal elmish model, you will call the whole <strong>view</strong> function again to rerender the whole dom tree no matter which piece of the data is changed.</p>
