<p>Yes, it is the same as what you can do with C#. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Counter() as this =
    inherit FunComponent()

    [&lt;Parameter&gt;]
    member val Count = 0 with get, set

    override _.Render() = div {
        this.Count
        button {
            onclick (fun _ -&gt; this.Count &lt;- this.Count + 1)
            &quot;Increase&quot;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
