<h1>About</h1>
<p>Adaptive is a based on <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Data.Adaptive">FSharp.Data.Adaptive</a>. In Fun.Blazor, we only used very small piece of its power <strong>ChangableValue</strong>, and the result is already very great. For its core concept, you can check on their documents.</p>
<p>In Fun.Blazor, we use it to isolate dynamic UI part. Because most of the time, your data changes will only affect specific part of the whole UI. So you can define things like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let yourUI =
    div {
        style { ... }
        childContent [
            ... a lot of stuff
            adaptiview () {
                let! msg = from store
                // only below part will be rerendered.
                div {
                    style { ... }
                    msg
                }
            } 
            ... a lot of stuff
        ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>And <strong>adaptiview</strong> can also accept parameters like isStatic/key, with this, even you recall <strong>yourUI</strong>, it will not affect the isolated part.</p>
