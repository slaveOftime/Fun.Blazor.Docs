<h1>How to Contribute</h1>
<p>If you want to contribute to the source code, just make a PR and @ me then I will take a look as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to documents (very welcomed, because my English is is not very good, so my documentation may not be very readable), there are some conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the docs is under <strong>Fun.Blazor.Docs.Wasm/Docs</strong>. They are just markdown, you can change it accordingly.</li>
<li>In the markdown file, the first line should be something like: <strong># your topic</strong></li>
<li>There is a number before every topic folder, it is used to sort the final menu accordingly</li>
<li>Under every folder, there is a <strong>README.md</strong> file. Which is the main entry to the topic.</li>
<li>You can make <strong>tree</strong> for your topic, if it has a lot of content. You just create subfolder and create another <strong>README.md</strong> file in it.</li>
<li>You can also include some live demos. You just need to add exactly this: <strong>{{the demo name under Fun.Blazor.Docs.Wasm/Demos}}</strong>. Take <strong>Counter</strong> as example</li>
</ul>
