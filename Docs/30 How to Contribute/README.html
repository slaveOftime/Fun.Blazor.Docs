<h1 id="how-to-contribute">How to Contribute</h1>
<p>If you want to contribute to the source code, simply create a PR and mention me with @, then I will review it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to the documentation (which is very welcome, as my English is not very good, so my documentation may not be very readable), there are some conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All documentation is located under <strong>Docs</strong>. They are just markdown files, so you can make changes accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The first line of the markdown file should be something like: <strong># your topic</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is a number before every topic folder; this is used to sort the final menu accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under every folder, there is a <strong>README.md</strong> file, which is the main entry point to the topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your topic has a lot of content, you can create subfolders and another <strong>README.md</strong> file in it to create a <strong>tree</strong> for better content organization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also include some live demos. To do so, you simply need to add this: <strong>{{the demo name under Fun.Blazor.Docs.Wasm/Demos}}</strong>. Use <strong>Counter</strong> as an example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
