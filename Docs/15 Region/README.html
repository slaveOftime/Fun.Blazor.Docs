<h1 id="region">Region</h1>
<p>Unlike blazor in csharp which is using razor engine to generate csharp code from html template. So it can create a static sequence number when compile to help improve DOM diff calculation. For more information about the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/advanced-scenarios?view=aspnetcore-7.0#sequence-numbers-relate-to-code-line-numbers-and-not-execution-order">sequence number and diff performance</a>.</p>
<p>But in Fun.Blazor everything is dynamic, so the sequence number can also change dynamically when you compose different fragment or component. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">div { // sequence 0
    childContent [
        if isLoading then
            loader
        div { // sequence may change
            &quot;hi&quot;
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>When <strong>isLoading</strong> is true, then the <strong>loader</strong> will be added, and the sequence number will change, because every time when we add attribute or node, we will increase the sequence number.</p>
<p>According to the official document, we developed <strong>region</strong> to help with this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">div { // sequence 0
    childContent [
        region { // sequence 1
            // Below content's sequence number is isolated
            if isLoading then
                loader
        }
        div { // sequence 2
            &quot;hi&quot; // sequence 3
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Most of the time, we will not even notice the difference with or without the <strong>region</strong>, but it is better to keep dynamic pieces in an isolated area both for readability and performance. And in Fun.Blazor, the <strong>fragment</strong>, <strong>adaptiview</strong> and <strong>html.inject</strong> already use <strong>region</strong> under the hood to isolate its content, so the sequence number changing will not amplifying. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">div { // sequence 0
    childContent [
        adaptiview () { // sequence 1
            match! isLoading with
            | true -&gt; loader
            | false -&gt; someDataView
        }
        div { // sequence 2
            &quot;hi&quot; // sequence 3
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
