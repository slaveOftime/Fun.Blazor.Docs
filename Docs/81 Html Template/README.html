<h1 id="html-template">HTML Template</h1>
<p>With the VSCode plugin and NuGet package <strong>Fun.Blazor.HtmlTemplate</strong>, we can nicely parse HTML templates at runtime and get IntelliSense at design-time.</p>
<p>However, currently, it is not very efficient, so it is not recommended to use heavily. But it should still be ok because we have an adaptive model and runtime cache.</p>
<p>The reason I built this is that for component libraries like shoelacejs, they are web components and do not have a Blazor wrapper around them. So to use them, we can auto-generate the DOM tree at runtime based on the plain string.</p>
<p>Additionally, VSCode has a very cool plugin (Highlight HTML/SQL templates in F#) that enables HTML/JS/CSS languages to be embedded in F#.</p>
