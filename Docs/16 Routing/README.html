<p>In Fun.Blazor, we have built-in routing support, but you can always use your own. The built-in routing is very simple and inspired by <a href="https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe">Giraffe</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, we will create a component to listen to the route changes and use an adaptive model internally, so if the actual path is not changed, the UI will not be re-rendered.</p>
<p>We also support some helper functions like <strong>routeCi &quot;/demo&quot; demoView</strong>. It is just a function: <code>UrlString -&gt; 'T option</code>. So if the return value has something, then it will return that thing. It can just be a view fragment or anything else.</p>
<p>Take the code below as an example:</p>
