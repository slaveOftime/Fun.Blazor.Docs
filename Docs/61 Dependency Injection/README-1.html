<pre><code>**DisableEventTriggerStateHasChanged** is turn on for all component which inherited from **FunBlazorComponent**. It is just a design decision. If you do not like the pattern like **html.inject/adaptiview** you can just create your own component and get the benefit of dom dsl and third party dsl support like MudBlazor from Fun.Blazor.

<p><strong>Dependency injection</strong> (DI) in a lot of softwares are very important. ASP.NET Core has build in support for that. And it is also good for testing and cross concern solutions. Not just services but also UI components can be powered by <strong>dependency injection</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>html.inject (they are same but with different name for different context)</strong> is used to inject the service you defined in DI container.</p>
