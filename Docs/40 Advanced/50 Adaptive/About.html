<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Adaptive is based on <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Data.Adaptive">FSharp.Data.Adaptive</a>. In Fun.Blazor, we only use a very small piece of its power <strong>ChangableValue</strong>, and the result is already great. For its core concept, you can check their documentation.</p>
<p>In Fun.Blazor, we use it to isolate dynamic UI parts. Because most of the time, your data changes will only affect a specific part of the whole UI. So you can define things like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let yourUI =
    div {
        style { ... }
        childContent [
            ... a lot of stuff
            adaptiview () {
                let! msg = from store
                // only below part will be rerendered.
                div {
                    style { ... }
                    msg
                }
            } 
            ... a lot of stuff
        ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p style="color: red">Please remember, the adaptive model is optional. If you do not like it, you can use your own model.</p>
<p>You may notice that you can also do the following, and it may look cleaner from a different point of view. But <strong>DisableEventTriggerStateHasChanged</strong> is turned on by default. The reason is to reduce the calculation of the virtual dom. With <strong>adaptiview</strong>, we can narrow the dom to a specific part for recalculating the dom in an isolated way. If you check the <strong>Form</strong> documentation, you will see it uses this pattern a lot. With that, we can have better performance for large UI dom trees.</p>
