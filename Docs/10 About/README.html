<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is a project to make F# developer to write blazor easier.</p>
<p>It is based on <a href="https://github.com/fsbolero/Bolero">bolero</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/alfonsogarciacaro/Feliz.Engine">Feliz.Engine</a> before.
Now <strong>(in V2)</strong> the dependency of bolero is removed to make it lighter. <strong>Feliz style is deprecated</strong> because it will cause more allocation and render loop than CE style in my previous implementation.</p>
<p>Anyway it is opinionated project, because I really like CE style, even its intellisense is not that good. Also I prefer adaptive model instead of Elmish. But you are not limited to use that, there is a package <strong>Fun.Blazor.Elmish</strong> to support that. Another thing is about dependency injection, I like that idea and find it is very useful when manage big applications. I know, I know, some functional programmers may not like that.</p>
<p>Below is a very simple counter which is using adaptive model.</p>
