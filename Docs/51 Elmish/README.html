<h1 id="elmish">Elmish</h1>
<p><strong>Fun.Blazor.Elmish</strong> is the package to support this.</p>
<p>I know Elmish is loved by a lot of F# developers including me. At the beginning, when I start work on my first FSharp related task, I use Fable + Elmish, then migrated to Feliz + Elmish hooks + Recoil. At that time, I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>For the core concept, you can check <a href="https://elmish.github.io/elmish/">Elmish official docs, the real MVU (LOL)</a></p>
