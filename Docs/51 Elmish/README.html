<h1 id="elmish">Elmish</h1>
<p><strong>Fun.Blazor.Elmish</strong> is the package that supports Elmish.</p>
<p>I know Elmish is loved by a lot of F# developers, including myself. When I started working on my first F# related task, I used Fable + Elmish, then migrated to Feliz + Elmish hooks + Recoil, which I really enjoyed at the time.</p>
<p>For the core concept, you can check the <a href="https://elmish.github.io/elmish/">Elmish official docs for the real MVU (LOL)</a></p>
