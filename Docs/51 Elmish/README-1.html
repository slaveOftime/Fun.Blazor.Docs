<p>There are also some helper functions under IComponentHook which can be used to combine adaptive and elmish together for better performance in <strong>simple use cases</strong>. Because in adaptive data, you can subscribe to the data you're interested in and trigger the specific UI part when the piece of data actually changes. Unlike normal Elmish model, where you would call the whole <strong>view</strong> function again to re-render the whole DOM tree no matter which piece of data has changed.</p>
